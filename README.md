# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<div align="justify">
My name is Steven Pak (Pharm.D), and I am an aspiring Full Stack Developer with a pharmacy and drug design background. Right now, I am a candidate in the Rizzo Lab in Stony Brook University for my PhD. The lab focuses on molecular docking of virtual molecules against a protein target. Not only we apply this technique to identify optimal compounds, but also we develop the very docking software we use!
